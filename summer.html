            <div><h2>Swedish landscapes</h2>
            <p>The Swedish countryside is dotted with thousands of lakes, freshwater streams, mountains
            and rolling hills. Starting up north, villages are few and small, nature fills in. The landscape 
            is very dramatic, and rolling hills rise into mountains. On the way south, you’ll pass by endless 
            numbers of lakes, streams, and pine and birch trees. On the Baltic island of Gotland, limestone 
            columns rise dramatically from the sea. And in southernmost Sweden, you’ll find everything from 
            deep-green potato fields to some of the richest apple orchards in Europe.So if there’s one thing 
            Sweden has plenty of, it’s open landscapes. Even those living in large cities like Stockholm or 
            Gothenburg have direct access to hundreds of unspoiled islands – just a short boat ride from the 
            city centre.</p>

            <div><h2>Day Light</h2>
            <p>
                Although the Swedish winters seem cold and dark, the long summer days are well worth the wait. 
                In most of the country, people stay outdoors well into the night, chatting in parks and outdoor 
                cafés as the sun barely dips below the horizon.As far south as Malmö, summer daylight outlasts 
                the average person’s waking hours. And in the far north, the sun never sets for weeks at a time.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div><h2>Time</h2>
            <p>Sweden is located in the Central European Time (CET) zone. Like in other European countries, summer 
            time is also observed here. This means that the clock is set forward one hour, from the last weekend 
            in March to the last weekend in October, in order to gain more daylight.</p>
